                <p>For the second time this year, the uncontrolled remnants of a Chinese Long March 5B came crashing to Earth. On Friday morning, US Space Command <a href="https://twitter.com/US_SpaceCom/status/1588502881631887361?s=20&amp;t=DfsgYf5IcAjaIYXw4lWWJQ"><ins>confirmed</ins></a> pieces of the rocket that carried the third and final piece of China's Tiangong space station to orbit had re-entered the planet’s atmosphere over the south-central Pacific Ocean, reports <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/science/china-rocket-debris.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>. The debris eventually plunged into the body of water, leaving no one harmed.</p><p>The episode marked the fourth uncontrolled re-entry for China’s most powerful heavy-lift rocket following its debut in 2020. Unlike many of its modern counterparts, including the SpaceX Falcon 9, the Long March 5B can’t reignite its engine to complete a predictable descent back to Earth. The rocket has yet to harm anyone (and probably won’t in the future). Still, each time China has sent a Long March 5B into space, astronomers and onlookers have anxiously followed its path back to the surface, worrying it might land somewhere people live. On Friday, Spain <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63513070"><ins>briefly closed parts of its airspace</ins></a> over risks posed by the debris from Monday’s mission, leading to hundreds of flight delays.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As he did earlier this year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-long-march-5b-re-entry-182425022.html"><ins>following China’s Wentian mission</ins></a>, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson criticized the country for not taking the appropriate precautions to prevent an out-of-control re-entry. “It is critical that all spacefaring nations are responsible and transparent in their space activities, and follow established best practices, especially, for the uncontrolled re-entry of a large rocket body debris — debris that could very well result in major damage or loss of life,” he said.</p><p>Space debris landing on Earth isn’t a problem unique to China. In August, for instance, a farmer in rural Australia found a piece of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/world/australia/spacex-debris-australia.html"><ins>SpaceX Crew Dragon</ins></a> spacecraft that landed on his farm. However, many experts stress that those incidents differ from the one that occured on Friday. “The thing I want to point out about this is that we, the world, don’t deliberately launch things this big intending them to fall wherever,” Ted Muelhaupt, an <a href="https://aerospacecorp.medium.com/a-massive-chinese-rocket-is-falling-uncontrollably-to-earth-db7c7b32d773"><ins>Aerospace Corporation</ins></a> consultant, told <em>The Times</em>. “We haven’t done that for 50 years.” China will launch another Long March 5B rocket next year when it attempts to put its Xuntian space telescope into orbit.</p>

The actress told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/11/margot-robbie-cover-babylon-star-on-navigating-hollywood">Vanity Fair</a> that her female-led take on Pirates of the Caribbean with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/5/21114321/birds-of-prey-review-harley-quinn-margot-robbie"><em>Birds of Prey</em></a><em> </em>screenwriter Christiana Hodson is no longer going forward at Disney.</p> <p id="LzXnyr">“We had an idea and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led — not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story — which we thought would’ve been really cool. But I guess they don’t want to do it,” Robbie said.</p> <p id="UL1BDa">The <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/margot-robbie-christina-hodson-pirates-of-the-caribbean-1234691611/">project was first announced back in 2020</a>, along with another separate reboot. In May 2022, Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer behind all five Pirates of the Caribbean movies, told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-inside-story-of-the-making-of-top-gun-maverick-cs79gww36">The Sunday Times</a> that the projects were still in development. What happened in between then and Robbie’s recent statement is unclear — nor is the fate of the second project.</p> <p id="dK2UHX">If Robbie is to be believed, it feels like Disney is missing out on an opportunity here, especially with HBO’s <em>Our Flag Means Death</em> bringing pirate media like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23023728/tumblr-pirates-of-the-caribbean-superwholock-jack-sparrow-barbossa"><em>Black Sails </em>(and, yes, Pirates of the Caribbean)</a> back into the zeitgeist. But even despite that, it’s sad to see the project shoved into Davy Jones’ locker, because a female-forward interpretation of the swashbuckling franchise is the absolute perfect evolution for it. </p> <p id="vpPTyM">Most people remember <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/6/21354492/captain-jack-sparrow-pirates-of-the-caribbean-movies">Johnny Depp’s roguish Jack Sparrow</a>, but one thing that made the original three Pirates of the Caribbean movies stand out was just how female-centric it was for a big fantasy genre film. By making governor’s daughter Elizabeth Swann such a central character, the filmmakers — whether intentionally or not — made the movies appeal specifically to young girls. After all, it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/8/6/21352683/pirates-of-the-caribbean-vs-star-wars-heros-journey-luke-skywalker">Elizabeth who goes on the clear hero’s journey</a>, from kidnapped damsel to stowaway sailor and eventually Pirate King.</p> <p id="XJeOtN">Without ever intending it, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/6/21352601/pirates-of-the-caribbean-ultimate-girlhood-fantasy">Pirates of the Caribbean movies became the ultimate girlhood fantasy</a>. Admittedly, there weren’t a whole lot of other women for Elizabeth to fight alongside, but that just makes a new Pirates movie centered around some badass ladies the natural next step. Instead of leaning into the Jack Sparrow of it all, the Pirates franchise could actually embrace what made those first three movies so damn special. Especially since the fifth movie discounted so much of her growth — you’re telling me that Pirate King Elizabeth Swann, who already went to hell and back for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/6/21337379/pirates-of-the-caribbean-romance-ranking-will-turner-jack-sparrow-james-norrington">Will Turner</a>, wouldn’t immediately get on a ship and sail with him to the ends of the Earth? </p> <p id="lXMYJy">Alas, we might never see Margot Robbie and her crew sail the seven seas. Maybe one day, in the distant future, beyond the horizon, Disney will realize that the key to cracking that franchise after two meh sequels is just making it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027291/marvel-cinematic-universe-women-upcoming-movies">unapologetically tailored towards girls</a>. </p>
